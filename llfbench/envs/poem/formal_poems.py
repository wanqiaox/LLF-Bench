    This environment is designed to be hierarchical. 
    It first determines a total number of lines to check. 
    If the number of generated lines is larger than the lines to check, it goes on to check the syllables in each line.
    Then, for each of these lines, it checks if the syllabus in each line is correct. 
    By 'correct', we mean that the number of syllables in each line should lie on one side of a threshold. 
    When the side is 1, the number of syllables should be larger than the threshold. 
    This threshold is determined by the [syllable_thres] parameter.
    The side of the threshold is determined by the [side] parameter.
